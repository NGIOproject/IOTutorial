The files in this folder are named in the following format:

benchio_{N}p_{D}_{r}.map
benchio_{N}p_{D}_{r}.o

where N is the number of processes that were used in a run, D is the length of
the cube of data that was written in the benchmark (i.e. a value of 128
indicates that each process wrote 128 x 128 x 128 double values), and r is the
run number to indicate where results from multiple runs have been collected.

The .map files are Allinea MAP profiles, and can be viewed using the Allinea
MAP profiling tool. The .o files contains the output to stdout when the
profiled runs were performed on ARCHER. These show the measured bandwidth
values (from the profiled program).
